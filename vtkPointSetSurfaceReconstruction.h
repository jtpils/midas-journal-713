// .NAME vtkPointSetNormalOrientation - Estimate normals of a point set using a local best fit plane.
// .SECTION Description
// This filter implements the technique described by Hoppe et al. 
// in ``Surface reconstruction from unorganized points''. This method 
// constructs a nearest neighbor graph on the points. As a good guess 
// at ``outside'', the technique finds the point with the largest z 
// value and adjusts that point's normal to point more toward the positive 
// z direction. This initial normal direction is propagated over a minimum 
// spanning tree computed over the graph.
